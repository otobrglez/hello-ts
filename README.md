# Introduction to TypeScript

By [Oto Brglez](https://github.com/otobrglez) for [Slovenia Ruby User Group Meetup](http://rug.si).

## What is TypeScript

- TypeScript is a free and open source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.
- It is a strict superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language.
- Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect of C# and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the development of TypeScript.
- TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for client-side or server-side (Node.js) execution.
- TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, any existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.
- The TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript, transcompiled to JavaScript and licensed under the Apache 2 License.
- TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like C/C++ header files can describe the structure of existing object files.
- TypeScript adds support for features such as classes, modules and an arrow function syntax as proposed in the upcoming ECMAScript 6 standard.

## Code
